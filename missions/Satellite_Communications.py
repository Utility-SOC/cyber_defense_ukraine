You'll connect an RTL-SDR dongle to the Raspberry Pi via USB to receive satellite signals. Next, you'd need to install 'GQRX' for SDR reception and 'GPredict' for satellite tracking. Run the command 'sudo apt-get install gqrx gpredict' to install these packages.{player.reset}")

Once it's in sight, switch to 'GQRX' and set the frequency to 137.62 MHz, which is the common frequency for NOAA satellites.{player.reset}")

To decode the received signals, you would typically run a Python script that utilizes the 'pyrtlsdr' library to interface with your RTL-SDR dongle. Run the command 'pip install pyrtlsdr' to install the library. Your next step would be to set the modulation to FM and bandwidth to 34,000 in GQRX. You've just learned how to set up a DIY satellite communication link!{player.reset}")
